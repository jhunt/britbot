BritBot - A Slack Bot for taunting the Brits
============================================

Did you know that one thing unites most of the world in peace and
celebration?  No, not our essential humanity or our shared home
that we like to call Earthâ€“it's actually Independence from the
British Empire!

Every ~6 days, another country celebrates their independence from
the Empire.  God Save the Queen!
